# STing datasets

This repository houses versed, automatically updated pre-built pubMLST databases for STing.  You can also find the version of the [CARD](https://card.mcmaster.ca/) and [VFDB](http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/main.htm) databases used in our paper.

The CARD and VFDB STing databases can be unarchived and used directly with `detector`.  Please see the included xRef files for converting gene ID to their respective annotation in CARD and VFDB.

The datafiles are updated weekly on Saturday.  Please see the releases page for up to date pre-built databases: https://github.com/jordanlab/STing_datasets/releases

We recommend building a new database each time STing is run, or daily if under continual use, to ensure the most up to date definitions as possible
